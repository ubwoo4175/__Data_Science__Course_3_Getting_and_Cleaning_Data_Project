# Coursera - Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
This repository is Rick Yoo's submission for Getting and Cleaning Data course project. 
It has the instructions on running the analysis on a Human Activity recognition dataset.

### Dataset
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

### Files
`CodeBook.md` : code book that explains the entire code (describes the variables, the data, transformations performed)

`run_analysis.R` : performs the data preparation plus the 5 steps described in the course projectâ€™s definition:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
`FinalData.txt` : exported final data in a txt file
